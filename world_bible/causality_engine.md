# Causality Engine (Canon)

## Definition
The Causality Engine is the mechanism by which **actions in the physical realm** trigger **contests in the spiritual realm**, and the outcomes feed back into the physical realm as consequence.

## Core Rule
A major act in the physical realm creates a corresponding spiritual event.

Example (canonical model):
- A murder occurs in the physical realm.
- A conflict is triggered in the spiritual realm.
- The spiritual outcome influences the “shape” of consequence:
  - exposure vs concealment,
  - guilt vs hardening,
  - escalation vs restraint,
  - protection vs vulnerability.

## The Code’s Role
The Code enforces that consequence cannot be avoided forever.
However, the pathway of consequence can be altered by spiritual conflict.

## Visibility
Most humans cannot see this system.
They only see:
- “luck,”
- “timing,”
- “coincidence,”
- “karma,”
- “curses,”
- “blessings.”
