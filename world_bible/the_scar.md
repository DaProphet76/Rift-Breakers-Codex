# The Scar

The Scar is a massive cratered region formed during the Sundering Fall.
Little to nothing lives within it.

## Summary
The Scar is treated as a forbidden zone and a living reminder that the world can be broken.
Even those who deny old beliefs still respect the Scar as a place where nature does not behave normally.

## Confirmed Properties
- **Habitation:** No stable settlements endure within the Scar.
- **Ecology:** Vegetation is sparse; animal life is rare and inconsistent.
- **Weather:** Storms and winds often bend around the region in unnatural patterns.
- **Navigation:** Landmarks shift under ash and erosion; maps are unreliable.
- **Expeditions:** Many fail; survivors are frequently traumatized or physically altered (cause not publicly agreed upon).

## Social Function
- The Scar is used as a political and cultural tool:
  - proof of divine judgment (by moral authorities),
  - proof of ancient hubris (by secular historians),
  - proof of unavoidable natural disaster (by official state narratives).

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** The Scar formed in the Sundering Fall and persists.
- **Intentionally unknown:** What exactly makes the region resistant to life.
- **Open questions:** Whether the Scar is “sealed,” “dormant,” or actively changing.
