## Summary
Babylonia is a fortified megacity constructed in concentric rings, serving as one of the most advanced and oppressive examples of post–Rift Age urban control. Designed for survivability and authority rather than freedom, Babylonia enforces rigid class separation through architecture, permits, and militarized infrastructure.

---

## Description
From a bird’s-eye view, Babylonia appears as a perfect circular city radiating outward from a sealed administrative core. Massive walls divide each ring, while internal districts are further segmented to allow rapid containment. Transit corridors cut radially through the city, tightly monitored and frequently restricted.

The city was engineered to endure Rift incursions—but also to ensure that power never diffuses outward.

## Ring Structure (Localized)

### **Ring 0 (Sector 0) — Administrative Core**
- Fully walled and isolated from the rest of the city.
- Seat of political authority and city governance.
- Residence of city politicians, ruling councils, and senior administrators.
- Central command for surveillance, permits, and enforcement.
- Access limited to approved personnel from Ring 1 and Ring 2 only.
- Districts within Ring 0 can be locked down independently.

---

### **Ring 1 — Elite Residential & High Services**
- Home to Babylonia’s upper-class citizens and influential families.
- High-end residential zones.
- Advanced medical facilities and specialized care centers.
- Premium education and controlled luxury services.
- Heavy security presence.
- Selective district lockdowns prevent ring-wide disruption.

---

### **Ring 2 — Infrastructure, Transit & Sustenance Sector**
- Logistical and economic backbone of Babylonia.
- Houses:
  - Vertical farming towers.
  - Hydroponic and aeroponic agriculture.
  - Cultured protein and ration-processing facilities.
  - Water filtration and purification plants.
  - Energy manufacturing and distribution nodes.
- Major transit hubs and docking systems.
- Strategic military outposts focused on infrastructure protection.
- Limited medical clinics for laborers and military staff.
- Ring 3 residents may enter **only for approved employment**, under strict permit control.

---

### **Ring 3 — Restricted Civilian Districts**
- Working-class residential zones.
- Home to citizens such as **Asher Renn**.
- Residents are largely confined to Ring 3 and the Outer Ring.
- Employment access typically limited to Ring 2.
- Minimal military presence.
- Several districts border exposed zones.
- Functions as a buffer between the inner city and external threats.

---

### **Outer Ring / Fringe**
- Least protected and most volatile region.
- Direct exposure to the surrounding realm and Rift-related dangers.
- Sparse military outposts used primarily for lookout and early warning.
- Secondary transport docks for overflow and emergency use.
- Infrastructure is unreliable; law enforcement response is slow.

---

## Environment / Conditions
- Inner rings are clean, brightly lit, and strictly regulated.
- Infrastructure quality degrades moving outward.
- Surveillance density drops sharply beyond Ring 2.
- Environmental exposure and danger increase significantly in the Outer Ring.

---

## Governance & Control
- Babylonia is governed from Ring 0.
- Movement between rings is enforced through permit tiers.
- District segmentation allows rapid suppression of unrest.
- Control is maintained through restriction and dependency rather than constant force.

---

## Narrative Use
- Grounds Asher’s limited mobility and life constraints.
- Establishes systemic inequality as an everyday reality.
- Provides multiple pressure points for political, social, and Rift-related conflict.

---

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** Babylonia fully implements the District Rings Doctrine.
- **Not revealed yet:** Who originally designed Babylonia’s layout.
- **Open questions:** Whether Babylonia was built for protection—or containment.
