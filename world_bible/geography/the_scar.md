## Summary
A massive cratered deadland created during the Sundering Fall. Little to nothing lives there, and storms bend around its edges.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** Cratered deadland; sparse/warped life; restricted/avoided by doctrine and law.
- **Intentionally unknown:** The deeper metaphysical cause.
- **Open questions:** What “changed” returned expeditions have actually endured.

## Details
**The Scar** is treated as both ruin and warning. Flora rarely takes root. Fauna is scarce and often viewed as altered. Weather patterns behave erratically—winds shear, cloudbanks split, and storms curl around its borders as if repelled.

Authorities restrict entry, citing public safety, contamination risk, or sacred prohibition (depending on district doctrine). The outer rings circulate darker stories: vanished caravans, silent ruins, and things seen moving where nothing should live.
