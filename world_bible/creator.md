# The Maker & The Code (Canon)

## The Maker
- Exists outside time and space.
- Creates without constraint.
- Does not require a realm to exist in order to exist.

## How Creation Works
1. The Maker generates **The Code**.
2. Through the Code, all created things come into being.
3. The Code continues to run as the “operating structure” of creation.

## The Code: What It Is
The Code is simultaneously:
- law,
- logic,
- spiritual order,
- authority,
- binding pattern.

It is not merely information; it is *living structure*.

## Dual Nature (Critical)
### 1) The True Code
- The original, living expression of the Maker’s design.
- Binds all planes.
- Cannot be fully expressed in words.

### 2) The Written Code
- A translated subset of the True Code.
- Expressed as laws/instructions for civilization.
- Intended to guide a society toward alignment.
- Not sufficient to grant power by itself.

## Binding & Awakening
The True Code can bind with beings.

When binding occurs, it can:
- awaken latent potential,
- enable abilities that exceed physical limits,
- increase “resonance” (sync) between a being and reality.

Binding is not possession.
Binding is alignment and union.

## Post-Cataclysm Withdrawal
After the Tear, the Maker no longer provides direct, obvious intervention in the physical realm.
The Code continues to operate.
