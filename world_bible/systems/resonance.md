## Summary
Resonance is a realm-wide imprint phenomenon that deposits an Echo in select individuals. Resonance events occur at defined triggers and produce measurable changes in spiritual sensitivity, resistance, and interaction with demonic pressure.

## Definitions
- **Resonance Event:** A structural surge that imprints Echoes.
- **Echo:** A dormant imprint that may awaken under pressure, exposure, or later triggers.
- **First Resonance (The Dig):** Realm-wide imprint event triggered by the unearthed artifact.
- **Second Resonance (Book 1):** Targeted imprint event triggered by Asher donning the incomplete left bracer.
- **Dormant:** Present but inactive; no reliable outward indicators.
- **Awakening:** Activation of Echo capabilities through stimulus or threshold crossing.

## Rules / Constraints
- Echo distribution is rare and not lineage-based.
- Echo distribution is not tribal-exclusive and not nation-exclusive.
- Echoes may appear randomly at birth; mechanism unknown (canon-unknown).
- Resonance does not grant “foreign magic”; it catalyzes what exists under covenant structure.
- Not all Echo-bearers awaken; awakening is conditional.
- Resonance effects do not nullify the Law; they operate within Law-defined bounds.

## Observable Effects
- Heightened perception of demonic presence or distortion.
- Increased resistance capacity under covenant alignment conditions.
- Elevated compatibility with armor-linked restoration.
- Increased institutional attention (testing, recruitment, containment).

## Failure Modes
- **False Positive Identification:** Institutions mislabel non-Echo individuals.
- **Counterfeit Manifestation:** Demonic influence mimics Echo-like effects.
- **Overstrain:** Echo-bearer destabilizes under pressure without support.
- **Suppression:** Institutional dampening delays or warps awakening.

## Institutional Use / Exploitation
- Confederacy runs evaluation and control programs to identify, recruit, or neutralize Echo-bearers.
- Sponsorship systems brand Echo potential as “advancement,” masking control.
- Demon-aligned actors attempt to corrupt Echo-bearers into counterfeit authority structures.

## Canon Notes
- The Dig Resonance implanted Echoes in a small, random group across nations.
- The Dig artifact is later revealed as a missing component of the left bracer.
- Book 1 Resonance imprints Echo specifically in: Asher, Sera, Kade, Rennick.
- Random birth manifestation exists; cause remains unknown (to be defined later).
