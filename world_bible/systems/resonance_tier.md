## Summary
Hero Sync measures how closely an individual's Echo aligns with the Resonance.
It is a measure of stability, not raw power.

## Tiers

### Tier I — Flicker
Minor anomalies. Often ignored or unregistered.

### Tier II — Aligned
Reliable manifestation. Academy eligible.

### Tier III — Harmonic
Independent operation. Public-facing heroes.

### Tier IV — Resonant
Rare. Strategic-level assets under strict control.

### Tier V — Unstable Sync
Terminal classification.

Subjects experience severe psychological destabilization, intrusive cognition,
self-harm or violence, and in some cases possession events due to open habitation channels.

No successful stabilization has ever been recorded.
All known cases end in death or demonic possession.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** Tier V is non-viable.
- **Suppressed:** Public acknowledgment of possession events.
- **Open questions:** Whether stabilization is possible at all.
