## Summary
Resonance Tier measures how closely an individual's Echo aligns with the Resonance.
It is a measure of stability and compatibility, not raw power.

## Tiers

### Tier I — Flicker
Minor anomalies. Often ignored or unregistered.

### Tier II — Aligned
Reliable manifestation. Academy eligible.

### Tier III — Harmonic
Independent operation. Public-facing heroes.

### Tier IV — Resonant
Rare. Strategic-level assets under strict control.

### Tier V — Unstable Sync
Terminal classification.

Subjects experience severe psychological destabilization, intrusive cognition,
self-harm or violence, and in some cases demonic possession events due to open habitation channels.

No successful stabilization has ever been recorded.
All known cases end in death or demonic possession.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** Tier V is non-viable.
- **Suppressed:** Public acknowledgment of possession events.
- **Open questions:** Whether stabilization is possible at all.
