## Summary
Covenant Authority is delegated governance power granted by the Maker to humanity when aligned with the Law. It governs legitimacy, resistance against demonic pressure, and structural stability.

## Definitions
- **Covenant:** Alignment agreement with the Law enabling delegated authority.
- **Authority:** Delegated right to govern, protect, and resist demonic influence.
- **Withdrawal:** Structural removal of delegated authority following covenant violation.
- **Restoration:** Structural return of authority through covenant-aligned events.

## Rules / Constraints
- Authority requires alignment with the Law.
- Authority diminishes through corruption, compromise, or deviation.
- Demons cannot override active covenant authority without a qualifying violation or permitted breach condition.
- Political power can imitate authority but cannot replace covenant alignment.
- Restoration is triggered by structural covenant events, not by institutional appointment.

## Observable Effects
- Increased resistance to demonic influence in aligned individuals/regions.
- Improved stability of territories under alignment.
- Greater clarity against deception and coercion.
- Reduced effectiveness of demonic pressure where authority is active.

## Failure Modes
- Corruption of leadership.
- Ideological replacement of the Law.
- Pride-driven misuse of delegated authority.
- Fragmentation into competing counterfeit authority systems.

## Institutional Use / Exploitation
- Confederacy mimics authority via law, force, branding, and sponsorship.
- Demon-aligned leadership pursues counterfeit authority through empowerment and rank.
- Armor-linked restoration reasserts covenant authority progressively through Asher (mechanics tracked in system and artifact entries).

## Canon Notes
- Covenant Authority was withdrawn as a governing structure during the Cataclysm.
- Restoration arc spans Book 1–3.
- Book 3 culminates covenant fulfillment and full restoration event timing.
