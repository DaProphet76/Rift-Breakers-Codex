## Summary
The Law is the objective moral and structural architecture of creation established by the Maker. Alignment with the Law determines legitimate authority and stability.

## Canon Notes
- Immutable in essence.
- Not cultural preference, tradition, or political doctrine.
- Applies across all tribes, nations, and continents.
- Demonic operation is bounded by Law-defined permission and constraints.
- Covenant Authority is contingent upon alignment with the Law.

## Details
- Defines moral truth and exposes deception.
- Establishes legitimate authority hierarchy and delegated governance bounds.
- Sets boundaries of spiritual access between realms.
- Governs covenant conditions (alignment, violation, withdrawal, restoration).

## Cultural Impact
- Widely distorted into “custom,” “ideology,” or “myth.”
- Confederacy reframes morality as political utility.
- Rediscovered progressively through Resonance and armor-linked restoration.

## Known Conflicts / Tensions
- Political pragmatism vs structural truth.
- Power-seeking vs alignment.
- Confederacy doctrine vs covenant structure.
- Fear-based compliance vs moral clarity.
