## Summary
The Maker is the singular Creator of all things. He exists outside time and space and governs creation through the Law.

## Canon Notes
- “The Maker” is the canonical name. “Father” is deprecated terminology.
- Exists beyond the physical realm and the spiritual realm.
- Morally perfect and sovereign.
- Allows free will within defined bounds.
- Demons operate only within permitted limits.
- Intervenes only at structural covenant moments.

## Details
- Established the Law as the moral and structural architecture of creation.
- Delegated covenant authority to humanity under alignment.
- Permits demonic operation only within constrained boundaries.
- Structural interventions include:
  - The Cataclysm (The Split)
  - Resonance imprint events
  - Covenant restoration timing

## Cultural Impact
- Knowledge of the Maker is fragmented across tribes and nations.
- Confederacy doctrine reframes or suppresses Maker-aligned truth.
- Survives through prophecy traditions and partial oral history.

## Known Conflicts / Tensions
- Sovereignty vs free will.
- Perceived silence vs covenant timing.
- Demonic permission bounds vs human interpretation.
- Covenant withdrawal vs restoration.
