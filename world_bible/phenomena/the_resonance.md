## Summary
A planet-wide surge released when an ancient artifact was unearthed. It left an **Echo** on human DNA, unlocking abilities in a subset of the population.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** Excavation event; artifact; global surge; Echo in DNA; abilities awakened randomly.
- **Intentionally unknown:** The artifact’s origin and the true nature of the surge.
- **Open questions:** Why some awakened and others did not; whether the Echo evolves across generations.

## Details
The Resonance is remembered as a single expanding wave—felt in every district, from inner towers to outer ghettos. The aftermath was immediate and uneven: some manifested abilities within days, others weeks, and most never did.

Public institutions frame the Resonance as miracle or progress. Corporations moved fastest: funding schools and programs to identify, train, and sponsor the awakened—turning survival into spectacle and control into “opportunity.”
