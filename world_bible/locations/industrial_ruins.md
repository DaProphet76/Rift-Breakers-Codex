## Summary
Industrial Ruins are abandoned outer-ring factory complexes left to decay after the Sundering, now serving as the primary scavenging grounds for remnant technology.

## Description
The ruins consist of skeletal factory shells, collapsed production halls, rusted steel frameworks, and shattered windows that expose interiors to the elements. Catwalks hang twisted or broken above debris-choked floors. Old machinery lies frozen mid-operation, half-buried under dust, ash, and corrosion.

Light enters through torn roofs and blown-out walls, creating long shadows and deceptive sightlines. Sound carries unpredictably, echoing through hollow chambers and making it difficult to judge distance or movement.

## Environment / Conditions
- Structurally unstable floors and ceilings  
- Rusted beams and weakened supports  
- Wind-driven dust, ash, and debris  
- Intermittent power surges from dormant systems  
- Cold, damp interiors regardless of exterior weather  

## Population / Control
- **Who controls it:** No formal authority  
- **Who uses it:** Scavengers, small crews, occasional gangs  
- Control is informal and temporary, enforced by presence or violence  

## Risks
- Sudden structural collapse  
- Rival scavenger encounters  
- Gang ambushes or territory disputes  
- Exposure to toxic residue or unstable tech  
- Fires or electrical discharges from disturbed systems  

## Narrative Use
Industrial Ruins serve as early-story survival spaces where danger is environmental and human rather than monstrous. They establish the scavenger economy, introduce faction tension, and reinforce the theme that the old world still powers the new—at a cost.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** These ruins are common throughout the outer rings.
- **Not revealed yet:** What still lies buried in deeper, sealed sections.
- **Open questions:** Which ruins were never fully evacuated before collapse.
