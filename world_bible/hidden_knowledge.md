# Hidden Knowledge (Canon)

## Public Belief (Physical Realm)
Most societies believe:
- the universe is purely physical,
- the “cataclysm age” was natural,
- spirituality is mythology or superstition.

## Fringe Awareness
A minority suspect more exists and seek access through:
- witchcraft and ritual systems,
- forbidden manuscripts and “old laws,”
- pacts with spiritual entities,
- anomalous locations and artifacts.

## True Reality
Fragments of the Written Code survived unevenly across cultures.
Fragments of True Code access occur in rare individuals (Chosen),
but are typically misunderstood or misclassified.

## Risk
Knowledge without alignment produces counterfeit systems:
- false codes,
- corrupted doctrines,
- ritual shortcuts that damage the user.

## Eight Families — Hidden Truth
- The so-called **Lesser Family** is not a single bloodline.
- Its **Twelve Branches** do **not** share one root seed.
- The doctrine of a “fractured lineage” is a controlled narrative used to justify caste behavior.
