# Cosmology (Canon)

## The Maker
- The Maker exists **outside** time, space, and causality.
- The Maker is not bound by any plane of existence.

## The Code
Before any realm exists, the Maker creates **The Code**.

The Code is the governing structure that:
- defines existence,
- binds planes together,
- enforces consequence,
- allows creation to persist without constant direct intervention.

Nothing exists outside the Code except the Maker.

## Dual Form
The Code expresses itself in two forms:

1. **The True Code**
   - living / spiritual / metaphysical
   - not dependent on language
   - cannot be fully contained by writing

2. **The Written Code**
   - laws / instructions / commandments
   - an incomplete translation of the True Code
   - given so civilizations may live in alignment even while spiritually blind

## The Tear
A historical cataclysm called **The Tear** split the unified created order into separated realms.
The physical world later misinterprets this as a natural disaster (e.g., “meteor era”).
