# Progression & Resonance (Canon)

## Key Terms
- **Resonance:** the degree to which a being is in sync with the True Code.
- **Binding:** when the True Code attaches to and works through a being.
- **Unlocking:** abilities manifesting as resonance increases.

## General Rule
Power is not learned like a skill first.
Power is **unlocked** as alignment increases.

## Stages (Simple Model)
1. **Dormant**
   - spiritually cut off
   - only written laws are accessible

2. **Awakening**
   - partial access to True Code begins
   - small abilities / perception changes appear

3. **Attunement**
   - abilities expand
   - discipline and moral alignment become mandatory

4. **Synchronization (Rare)**
   - deep union with the Code
   - still not total mastery

## Limitation (Mandatory)
No created being fully understands or fully masters the Code.
Even the most aligned can only:
- interpret,
- align,
- endure.

## Cost
Attempting to unlock without alignment results in instability:
- corruption,
- mental collapse,
- spiritual fracture,
- uncontrolled manifestations.
