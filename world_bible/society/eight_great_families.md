## Summary
Eight ancestral families underpin civilization. Seven are recognized as “high” and compete for legitimacy; one is treated as lesser—publicly believed to be one lineage with twelve branches, though the branches do not share the same root seed.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** 8 families; 7 high; 1 lesser with 12 branches; slavery abolished but discrimination persists.
- **Intentionally unknown:** The branches’ true origins and why they were bound together as “one family.”
- **Open questions:** Which event/authority first codified the Eight-Family doctrine.

## Details

### The Seven High Families (doctrine list)
- **House Valenor** — Law and civil order  
- **House Kethryn** — Military authority  
- **House Aurel** — Commerce and central governance (dominant in the present era)  
- **House Solmyr** — Knowledge and sanctioned history  
- **House Dravain** — Infrastructure and district planning  
- **House Elyndor** — Culture and media  
- **House Marric** — Civic doctrine and moral councils  

### The Lesser Family (public belief vs truth)
**Public belief:** One diminished family fractured into **twelve branches**.  
**Hidden truth:** The twelve branches do **not** share the same root seed.

Slavery tied to this population has been abolished in law, but in practice they remain the “acceptable target” for blame, exclusion, and deprivation.

### District Stratification (present-world structure)
Districts are organized in rings:
- **Inner Sanctum:** concentrated security and governance; House Aurel influence is strongest.
- **Second Ring:** favored administrators, officers, and allied households; high-family presence remains dense.
- **Outer Rings:** lesser-family descendants and former slaves; reduced protection; highest exposure to rift incidents.

The ruling people exist across all districts, but safety and power thin with distance. The outer rings carry the cost.
