## Overview
A multi-nation power bloc formed after the Cataclysm to consolidate governance, control resources, and suppress the Chosen Nation (Twelve Tribes). The Confederacy presents itself as lawful order while operating as a layered system of policy control, economic pressure, and sanctioned force.

## Structure
- **Member Nations (8):** Edom, Amalek, Moab, Ammon, Ishmael, Philistine, Elam, Canaan
- **Public Governance Layer:** visible councils, law codes, trade compacts, military accords
- **Policy Layer:** inter-nation directives that standardize suppression and resource extraction
- **Shadow Layer:** concealed influence networks that steer decisions without attribution

## Goals
- Maintain regional dominance across continents.
- Prevent restoration of covenant authority among the Twelve Tribes.
- Control Resonance identification, containment, and exploitation.
- Preserve internal stability through managed conflict and external oppression.

## Methods
- Sponsorship and advancement systems.
- Controlled trade access and pricing manipulation.
- Military deterrence and “peacekeeping” deployments.
- Information control through doctrine and education.
- Selective enforcement and list-based governance.

## Relationships
- **Twelve Tribes (Chosen Nation):** primary suppressed population and strategic target.
- **Independent Tribes/Nations:** coerced into trade dependence or treaty alignment.
- **Demonic Influence:** varies by nation; denied publicly; leveraged privately by some actors.

## Notable Members
- Nation leadership councils (varies by member).
- Confederacy-appointed governors and military commanders.
- Institutional directors for evaluation/testing programs.

## Canon Notes
- Confederacy influence varies regionally but remains the dominant power structure.
- Amalek is counted as its own nation while being a sub-lineage of Edom.
- The Confederacy’s “order” replaces covenant structures without true alignment.
