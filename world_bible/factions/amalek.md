## Overview
A distinct confederate nation counted among the Eight, descended as a sub-lineage of Edom. Amalek operates from concealed influence networks and directs high-level policy without public attribution.

## Structure
- Hidden directorate (non-public).
- Embedded advisors within Edom governance.
- Black-budget procurement and intelligence operations.
- Proxy commanders and intermediaries in other nations.

## Goals
- Direct the Confederacy’s long-term policy arc.
- Maintain shadow control over Edom’s visible authority.
- Prevent covenant restoration among the Twelve Tribes.
- Secure strategic advantage through information asymmetry.

## Methods
- Covert policy steering and engineered crises.
- Control of sensitive programs (evaluation, containment, infiltration).
- Assassination, kompromat, and forced loyalty structures (as needed).
- Strategic alliances with demonic-adjacent actors (denied publicly).

## Relationships
- **Edom:** sub-lineage origin; primary host and public shield.
- **Philistine:** persistent tension due to refusal to be subdued.
- **Other Confederacy Nations:** leveraged through favors, secrets, and dependency.
