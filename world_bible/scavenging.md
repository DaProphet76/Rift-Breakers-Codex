## Summary
Scavenging is the primary survival economy of the outer districts, where individuals and small groups risk collapse, violence, and exposure to recover remnant technology from pre-Sundering ruins and wreckage.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** Scavenging is common, dangerous, and poorly regulated.
- **Not revealed yet:** Who controls large-scale salvage operations.
- **Open questions:** How much pre-Sundering tech still functions intact.

## Details
Scavenging takes place primarily in abandoned industrial zones, derelict factories, and crash sites scattered throughout the outer rings. These areas were once functional parts of the city’s production and transport network and are now hollowed-out shells of rust, concrete, and shadow.

Most scavengers are not trained technicians. They search by experience, rumor, and instinct, stripping anything that can be reused, repaired, or sold. Value is determined not by understanding an object’s purpose, but by whether someone in the city will trade for it.

### Common Targets
- Power conduits and cabling  
- Motors, actuators, and mechanical assemblies  
- Control modules and interface panels  
- Energy cells and portable power units  
- Medical kits recovered from transport wrecks  

### Downed Transports
Transport wrecks are considered high-risk, high-value sites. They are often unstable, partially buried, or already contested. Many scavengers die attempting to access sealed compartments or extract power cores.

## Cultural Impact
Scavengers are viewed with mixed attitudes:
- Necessary for keeping parts of the city running
- Disposable by authorities and gangs
- Feared for what they might uncover

Among scavengers themselves, superstition is common. Certain ruins are avoided entirely, while others are believed to be “picked clean” despite evidence to the contrary.

## Known Conflicts / Tensions
- Rival scavenger crews fighting over claims
- Gangs taxing or controlling access to ruins
- Structural collapses triggered by careless extraction
- Disputes over whether a site is “dead” or still worth risking
