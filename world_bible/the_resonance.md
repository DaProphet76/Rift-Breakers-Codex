# The Resonance

## Summary
The Resonance is the planetary-scale surge released when an archaeological dig unearthed a dormant artifact.
The Resonance left an **Echo** within human DNA that unlocked latent abilities in a random subset of the population.

## The Dig Event (High-Level)
- A sealed artifact was discovered during an excavation.
- Upon unsealing/activation, a bright energy event occurred.
- The event propagated outward and encompassed the planet.

## The Echo
- The Resonance imprinted a persistent “Echo” on human biology.
- The Echo manifests as awakenings:
  - unpredictable in who receives it,
  - variable in magnitude,
  - often triggered under stress or exposure to Rift phenomena.

## Immediate Consequences
- Rift threats became survivable in localized areas due to awakened defenders.
- Awakened individuals became public symbols (heroes, gladiators, icons).
- Training institutions emerged rapidly, increasingly funded and managed by corporations.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** The Resonance caused the Echo; the Echo unlocks abilities.
- **Intentionally unknown:** Why awakenings select certain individuals.
- **Open questions:** Whether the artifact is now dormant, depleted, or waiting for a second phase.
