# The Tear (Canon)

## Definition
**The Tear** is a catastrophic rupture that split what was once a unified created order into separated realms.

## Cause
Accumulated disobedience (sin) against the Maker’s intended order created systemic instability.
To contain spread, the Tear was triggered as a containment measure.

## Effects
- The physical realm became largely blind to the spiritual realm.
- Influence did not stop; it became indirect and contested.
- Knowledge of true origins decayed over time.
- The cataclysm was eventually reinterpreted as a natural event in mainstream history.

## Narrative Function
The Tear is the core mystery mechanism:
- Characters live with partial truth.
- The author retains full canon truth here.
