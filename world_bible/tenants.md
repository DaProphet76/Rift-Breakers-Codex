# Tenants (Written Code) — Canon

## Purpose
The Tenants are the **written laws/instructions** derived from the True Code.

They exist because most beings:
- cannot perceive the True Code,
- require external structure to form stable civilization,
- must learn alignment through practice before resonance is possible.

## What Tenants Can Do
- shape culture and moral boundaries,
- reduce chaos and self-destruction,
- prepare individuals for possible future resonance.

## What Tenants Cannot Do
- they do not automatically grant abilities,
- they do not force spiritual access,
- they do not replace the True Code.

## Structure (Template)
Use this template when you later write the actual Tenants:

1. **Moral Law** (how to live)
2. **Metaphysical Law** (what reality requires)
3. **Consequence Clause** (what happens when violated)
4. **Restoration Path** (what realignment looks like)
