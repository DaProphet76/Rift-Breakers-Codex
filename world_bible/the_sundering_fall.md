# The Sundering Fall

The Sundering Fall is the age-ending catastrophe that shattered the old world order and reshaped the realm.

## Confirmed Outcomes
- A planetary-scale destruction event occurred (firefall, seismic rupture, mass collapse).
- Old nations and infrastructure failed at near-total scale.
- Population displacement led to famine, migration, and long wars over remaining habitable land.
- A persistent cratered deadland (**The Scar**) formed and remains largely uninhabitable.

## Cultural Aftermath
- The post-Fall centuries are remembered as “rebuilding,” but the practical reality was continuous war:
  - resource wars,
  - border wars,
  - succession wars,
  - purges and forced relocations.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** The Scar exists and is a direct physical legacy of the Sundering Fall.
- **Intentionally unknown:** The full metaphysical cause of the Sundering Fall (kept for later revelation).
- **Open questions:** What precise sequence of events created the Scar, and what persists there.
