# Realms (Canon)

## Ethereal Realm (Maker’s Domain)
- Not inside time or space.
- Not accessible through normal travel.
- The Maker’s existence is not dependent on any created realm.

## Physical Realm
- The realm of matter, biology, and measurable physics.
- Most civilizations believe it is the only reality.
- History and science contain major blind spots caused by lost knowledge of the Tear.

## Spiritual Realm
- The realm of non-physical conflict, influence, and enforcement that interfaces with the Code.
- Events in the physical realm can trigger spiritual outcomes.
- Spiritual outcomes can shape probability, opportunity, and consequence in the physical realm.

## Separation
The Tear enforces a separation between physical awareness and spiritual reality.
This separation is incomplete: influence still passes through the Code.
