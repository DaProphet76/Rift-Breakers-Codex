# Eight Great Families

## Summary
The realm’s nations and political legitimacy are organized around the doctrine of the Eight Great Families.
This doctrine is taught as origin-history, law-justification, and class-structure in one.

## Public Doctrine
- There are **Eight Great Families** from whom all nations descend.
- **Seven High Families** compete for rulership and prestige.
- **One Lesser Family** is treated as inferior and historically enslaved.
- The Lesser Family is said to have **Twelve Branches**, viewed as fractured offshoots of a diminished lineage.

## Power Reality (Present Era)
- One High Family functions as the de facto controlling power (through law, finance, and corporate systems),
  while the other six compete within limits.
- High Family members exist in all districts, but concentrate in the protected rings.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** The Eight-Family doctrine is the dominant public framework.
- **Intentionally unknown:** The names and full genealogy of the Twelve Branches (to be created later).
- **Open questions:** What mechanisms keep the six rival High Families contained without open civil collapse.
