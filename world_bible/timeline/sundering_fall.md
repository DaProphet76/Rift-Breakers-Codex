## Summary
A realm-shattering cataclysm of fire, stone, and upheaval that ended the First Age and left a permanent deadland crater known as **the Scar**.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** The Scar exists; little to nothing lives within it; it formed during the Sundering Fall.
- **Intentionally unknown:** The deeper truth behind the Sundering (and the split of realms) is not revealed in present-time doctrine.
- **Open questions:** Why storms bend around the Scar; why expeditions rarely return unchanged.

## Details
In taught history, the Sundering Fall is the night the sky broke and the land was rewritten. Cities collapsed, seas shifted, and survivors were scattered into famine and migration.

The most visible wound is **the Scar**—a vast cratered region where life fails and weather behaves unnaturally. It became a geographic warning and a political boundary: rulers restrict access, and common people avoid it.

The Sundering Fall is followed by generations of rebuilding and war—conflicts framed as “necessary” by the victors and remembered as “theft” by those pushed outward.
