## Summary
The Cataclysm, known as The Split, was a structural intervention event triggered by covenant violation. It resulted in covenant withdrawal and a tearing of reality that expanded demonic access within permitted bounds.

## Date / Era
Generations before the Dig and Book 1.

## What Happened
- A chosen nation (multiple tribes) was established to guide and rule under covenant authority.
- The chosen nation abandoned alignment with the Law.
- Corruption accelerated and spread through tribal and national structures.
- The Maker removed the ruling palace from the realm.
- Reality tore.
- Demonic access increased within Law-permitted bounds.
- The chosen nation fell from authority into servitude.
- Political fragmentation followed.

## Consequences
- Covenant Authority ceased as a governing structure.
- New political regimes and consolidations rose to fill the vacuum.
- Cultural amnesia and doctrinal distortion of pre-Cataclysm truth.
- Demonic intrusion pressure increased across regions.

## What People Are Taught
- The Cataclysm was a natural disaster.
- Authority is purely political and inherited.
- The old covenant is irrelevant, extinct, or dangerous.
- Demons are myth, exaggeration, or propaganda.

## Canon Notes
- Structural intervention, not annihilation.
- Not random destruction.
- Directly tied to covenant violation.
- Establishes the long arc of covenant restoration.
