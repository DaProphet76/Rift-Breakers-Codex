# District Rings

## Summary
After the Rift Age escalated, populations concentrated into fortified district-cities.
The districts formed rings of safety and power around a protected inner core.

## Structure
### Inner Sanctum (Center District)
- Highest protection, surveillance, and response capability.
- Seat of administrative and corporate authority.
- High Families maintain continuous presence.

### Second Ring
- Professional class, sanctioned labor, officers, favored trades.
- Strong defensive coverage and controlled access.

### Outer Rings
- Diminished protection; frequent incursions.
- Formerly enslaved populations and the socially degraded “lesser” peoples are concentrated here.
- Resource scarcity and predatory policing are common.

## Social Rule (De Facto)
- Slavery is abolished in law, but caste behavior persists:
  - enforced employment dependency,
  - restricted mobility,
  - cultural hatred and stigma,
  - disproportionate exposure to Rift incursions.

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** Ring stratification exists and shapes every major institution.
- **Intentionally unknown:** The full administrative blueprint of every district (varies by region).
- **Open questions:** How outer-ring residents organize mutual defense before/after the Resonance.
