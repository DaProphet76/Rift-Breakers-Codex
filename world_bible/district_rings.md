## Summary
Following the escalation of the Rift Age, populations consolidated into fortified district-cities. These cities were constructed in concentric rings of security, privilege, and control, surrounding a protected inner core. While slavery was abolished in law, ring-based stratification formalized a new caste system that governs mobility, labor, and survival.

## Structural Doctrine
- Cities are divided into **concentric rings**, each functioning as a sector.
- Each ring contains **multiple districts**, themselves internally walled.
- Districts and rings can be **sealed independently** to contain unrest or incursions.
- The closer one lives to the center, the greater the protection, privilege, and authority.

This structure prioritizes survivability and control over equality.

## Ring Structure

### **Ring 0 (Inner Sanctum / Administrative Core)**
- Highest protection, surveillance, and response capability.
- Seat of political, administrative, and institutional authority.
- Residence of ruling councils, High Families, and governing elites.
- Fully enclosed by a hardened perimeter wall.
- Internal districts are segmented for instant lockdown.
- Access restricted to sanctioned personnel from adjacent rings only.

---

### **Ring 1 — Sanctioned Elite & High Services**
- Home to the professional and governing-adjacent classes.
- Senior officers, favored trades, medical elites, and approved specialists.
- Advanced medical facilities and premium services.
- Strong defensive coverage and controlled access.
- District-level containment prevents ring-wide disruption.

---

### **Ring 2 — Infrastructure, Transit & Sustenance**
- Logistical backbone of ring-based cities.
- Houses:
  - Food production (vertical farms, hydroponics, ration processing).
  - Energy manufacturing and distribution.
  - Water filtration and purification.
  - Primary transit docks and corridors.
- Strategic military outposts focused on infrastructure protection.
- Functional medical clinics for laborers and security forces.
- Lower-ring residents may enter **only for sanctioned labor**, under permit.

---

### **Ring 3 — Outer Civilian Districts**
- Concentration of the working class and restricted populations.
- Diminished protection and delayed response times.
- Employment access typically limited to Ring 2.
- Minimal military presence.
- Several districts border exposed or unstable zones.
- Serves as a buffer between inner authority and outer danger.

---

### **Outer Rings / Fringe**
- Lowest protection and highest exposure to Rift activity.
- Frequent incursions and environmental instability.
- Sparse military outposts serving primarily as lookout and early warning.
- Resource scarcity, informal economies, and predatory policing are common.
- Often inhabited by socially degraded or displaced populations.

---

## Social Rule (De Facto)
Although slavery is abolished in law, caste behavior persists through:
- Enforced employment dependency.
- Restricted mobility between rings.
- Cultural hatred and inherited stigma.
- Disproportionate exposure to Rift incursions and environmental danger.

The ring one is born into often determines the life one is permitted to live.

---

## Canon Notes
- **Confirmed:** Ring stratification shapes governance, labor, and survival.
- **Intentionally unknown:** Exact layouts and enforcement vary by region and city.
- **Open questions:** How outer-ring populations organize mutual defense before and after Resonance events.
