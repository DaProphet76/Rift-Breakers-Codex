# Tenants (Canon Rules)

1. **Creation is intentional.** Nothing exists by accident; all existence originates from the Maker.
2. **Reality was once unified.** The realms were not always separated.
3. **The Cataclysm (the Tear) fractured reality.** The split was caused and has ongoing consequences.
4. **Actions have dual consequences.** Meaningful physical actions produce spiritual effects.
5. **Violence triggers spiritual conflict.** Grave harm (e.g., murder) initiates spiritual confrontation with downstream impact.
6. **Knowledge divides perception.** Awareness of the Spiritual Realm is restricted and costly.
7. **The Maker does not intervene directly.** Post-Cataclysm, governance is via established laws, not direct action.
8. **Power requires permission or transgression.** Exceeding nature requires authority—or incurs imbalance.
9. **Balance is not morality.** Reality responds to imbalance, not intent.
10. **Truth cannot be destroyed.** Truth can be buried or distorted but will resurface.
