# Asher Renn

## Quick Summary (1–2 lines)
Outer-ring workhand and scavenger who avoids gangs and survives by pattern-reading and restraint—until a forbidden sector “notices” him and triggers something inside him.

---

## Identity
- **Name:** Asher Renn
- **Aliases / Street Handles:** (TBD if any)
- **Age:** (TBD)
- **Origin:** Outer Ring (District Rings)
- **Status:** Unaffiliated scavenger / workhand
- **Occupation:** Shift labor + opportunistic scavenging runs

---

## Overview
Asher lives by rules that keep people alive in the outer ring: don’t posture, don’t sign colors, don’t linger, and don’t trust easy money. He’s close with **Kellan** (friend) and watched over—quietly—by **Mara** (community elder). His routine fractures when **Kade** pulls him toward a scavenging run that crosses into rival lanes for a real payout.

The run turns into a trap. People die fast. Others are beaten and scattered. Asher ends up with Kade and a man named **Rennick**—and the only way out forces them into a forbidden sector where reality behaves wrong, and Asher reacts as if the place recognizes him.

---

## Appearance
- **Build:** Lean / work-worn (TBD specifics)
- **Clothing:** Practical outer-ring layers; gloves for shift work; inner pocket space for tools
- **Notable Items on Person:** A narrow tool sleeve (fine cutters + micro-driver), kept close to the ribs

---

## Role in Story
- **Narrative role:** Supportive lead / witness catalyst (not the main hero)
- **Function:** Shows the reader how the outer ring works; becomes the “first recognized piece” in a larger system
- **Early theme:** Survival-by-restraint vs. survival-by-power

---

## Motivations
- **Primary:** Stay alive; keep freedom (no gang bindings); keep his circle safe
- **Secondary:** Earn enough credits/resources to reduce dependency on shifts and ration systems
- **Hidden / emerging:** Understand what is happening to him after the forbidden sector incident

---

## Personality
- **Baseline:** Observant, cautious, controlled
- **Social posture:** Low profile; measured speech; doesn’t escalate
- **Core belief:** Patterns keep you alive—until they don’t
- **Pressure response:** Goes quiet, tracks exits, commits fast once the decision is made

---

## Background & History (Canon Anchors)
- Finishes a shift under a district atmosphere shaped by lockdown procedures and “lists.”  
- Has a friend bond with **Kellan**, and a guarded, watchful connection with **Mara**.  
- Is approached by **Kade** for a scavenging run; Asher sets a boundary: **no gangs**.  
- Joins the run anyway due to timing, scarcity, and the promise of real payout.  
- During the run, they recover practical salvage (not treasure): coil-winder, power cells, and Asher’s tool sleeve.  
- Rival territory turns lethal: two are murdered; others are beaten and scattered.  
- Asher, Kade, and Rennick cross into a forbidden sector; Asher senses distortions and triggers an involuntary “response,” as if the place recognizes him.

---

## Relationships
### Allies / Trusted
- **Kellan:** Friend from the lanes; shared survival history; honest rapport.
- **Mara:** Community elder figure; watches, warns, and reads the district mood.

### Conditional / Complicated
- **Kade:** Not a friend. A dangerous ally-of-opportunity with street competence and unclear loyalties.

### Antagonistic
- **Rival gang presence:** Organized, patient, hunter-like pursuit and violence during the run.
- **The system behind “testing” and “lists”:** Institutional pressure that shapes choices long before weapons come out.

---

## Skills & Competencies (Story-Facing)
- **Situational awareness:** Reads corridors, people, spacing, symbols, timing
- **Scavenger tradecraft:** Handling salvage quietly; concealment; moving without drawing attention
- **Repair aptitude:** Fine-tool use (micro-driver, cutters); practical fixing mindset
- **Self-control:** Can swallow pride; avoids escalation; prioritizes survivability

---

## Gear (Current / Known)
- **Tool sleeve:** Fine cutters + micro-driver (repair-enabling kit, not a weapon)
- **Work gloves:** For shift labor
- **Basic carry:** (TBD)

---

## Internal Conflict
Asher’s survival model is built on avoiding notice. The forbidden sector event implies the opposite: **he is being noticed**, possibly selected, possibly “keyed” to something he doesn’t understand.

---

## Arc Hooks (What this sets up)
- **Awakening seed:** The city/sector responds to Asher before Asher can choose anything.
- **Choice pressure:** Stay invisible (outer ring rules) vs. investigate what changed.
- **Bridge role:** Asher is positioned to *introduce the true hero* by being the first to stumble into the deeper mechanism.

# 5E Character Sheet Adaptation (Draft — for your approval)

> This section is intentionally marked **DRAFT** so we don’t accidentally “canonize” numbers you haven’t chosen yet.

## Core Concept (DRAFT)
- **Suggested Class:** Rogue (Scout) *or* Artificer (tinker/repair lean)  
- **Suggested Level:** 1 (early story)
- **Suggested Background:** Custom “Outer-Ring Scavenger” (Urchin / Criminal variant fit)
- **Suggested Alignment:** Neutral (Survival-driven)

## Personality Traits / Ideals / Bonds / Flaws (DRAFT)
- **Traits:** Quiet observer; keeps his voice level; watches exits and walls.
- **Ideal:** Freedom—“No colors. No vows.”
- **Bond:** Kellan and Mara (home-lane anchors).
- **Flaw:** Hesitation until forced; distrust can isolate him at the wrong moment.

## Skill Proficiency Targets (DRAFT)
- **High fit:** Perception, Stealth, Investigation, Survival
- **Secondary fit:** Sleight of Hand, Insight

## Ability Score Priorities (DRAFT)
- **Primary:** Dexterity, Wisdom
- **Secondary:** Intelligence (repair/analysis lean)
- **Lower:** Charisma (not a talker), Strength (lean build)

## Equipment Notes (DRAFT)
- Thieves’/tinker-style tools reskinned as scavenger repair kit
- Light armor equivalent reskinned as reinforced outer-ring layers

---

## Notes
- Kade and Rennick are major relational anchors for Asher in Chapter 2 material but do not yet have dedicated character pages in the current codex package (create when ready).

## Open Questions (You decide)
1. Asher’s exact **age** and **family status** (orphaned? separated? unknown?)
2. Does Asher have a **street handle**, or is “Renn” already the short form people use?
3. What is Asher’s **job type** on-shift (sorter, porter, salvage clerk, conduit-runner)?
4. What exact **trigger** in the forbidden sector keyed to him (bloodline? resonance? artifact proximity? moral state?)
