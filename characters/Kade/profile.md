## Character Profile (Story-Facing)

### Quick Identity
- Full Name Kade (Last name TBD)
- Aliases “Kade”
- Origin  District Babylonia — Outer Ring (exact district TBD)
- Age 19
- Role in Story Street-connected scavenger who pulls Asher into the lanes and becomes a core survivor of the early rift events.

### Appearance
Lean, wiry build; quick hands; usually hooded or masked when moving lanes. Keeps gear light and silent (strap pack, gloves, utility belt). Visible wear from outer-ring living scuffed boots, patched layers, dust-stained fabrics.

### Personality
- Strengths Observant; decisive under pressure; resourceful; loyal once trust is earned
- Flaws Risk-tolerant; guarded; can over-control situations; quick to assume betrayal
- Fears Being “taken” by liststesting; being trapped with no exit; losing autonomy to inner-ring power
- Desires Freedom of movement; enough credit to stop living shift-to-shift; a “real exit” from outer-ring rules

### Background
Outer-ring survivor culture shaped him early ration math, checkpoint habits, and the scavenger economy. Learned routes, rival lanes, and the practical politics of who owns what corridor. He operates through contacts and favors rather than formal structures.

### Motivations
- Short-term Secure high-value salvage and keep his people alive through the next rotation cycle
- Long-term Build leverage (credits + contacts + proof) strong enough to change his status without becoming property of a sponsor program

### Relationships
- Asher Renn Recruitally-in-formation; sees potential usefulness and a rare steadiness
- Rennick Fellow survivor asset (relationship specifics TBD)
- Outer-ring contacts Informal network (names TBD)

### Arc
- Start Competent scavenger who believes control and speed beat everything
- Pressure Rifts, the Wraith, and sponsor systems make “skill” insufficient
- Change Learns that survival requires trust and sacrifice, not only tactics
- End state (planned) TBD

### Secrets  Reveals
- He knows more about certain scavenger routes and “forbidden sector” boundaries than he admits (source and why TBD).
- He has a private rule about sponsorshiptesting—he will not be processed (how far he’ll go to avoid it TBD).
