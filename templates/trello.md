# Trello Workflow Instructions  
**Rift Breakers – Story Master Board**

This document defines how Trello is used in this project.  
Trello is a **tracking and constraint system**, not a writing surface.

---

## Board Purpose

- Track chapter state
- Enforce narrative flow
- Prevent canon drift
- Coordinate assistant execution

**All prose lives outside Trello.**

---

## Column Definitions (Left → Right)

### 1. Story Spine (Locked Canon)
- World rules
- Artifact laws
- Ring structure
- Resonance rules
- Permanent truths

**Rules**
- Cards never move
- No chapter content allowed
- Canon reference only

---

### 2. Templates
- Chapter card templates only
- No active work
- Used by duplication

**Rules**
- Never move cards out of this column
- Templates are structural only

---

### 3. Chapter Queue
- Planned chapters
- One card = one chapter
- Ordered intentionally

**Rules**
- No prose
- Must follow chapter card template

---

### 4. Writing This Week
- Active writing only
- Maximum 3 chapters at once

**Rules**
- Assistant may write prose ONLY for cards in this column
- Card must be complete before drafting begins

---

### 5. Drafted (1st Pass)
- Full draft exists outside Trello
- No structural changes here

**Rules**
- Prose revisions only
- No new events introduced

---

### 6. Revisions
- Continuity fixes
- Pacing edits
- Canon alignment

**Rules**
- Canon conflicts must be resolved here
- Assistant flags issues before changes

---

### 7. Locked / Canon
- Finalized chapters
- Immutable

**Rules**
- Never edit directly
- Clone card if changes are required
- Locked chapters define future constraints

---

## Chapter Card Requirements

Every chapter card MUST contain:

### Metadata
- Book
- Chapter number
- POV
- Location
- Timeline position

### Story Beats
- Opening beat
- Inciting event
- Midpoint shift
- Consequence
- Closing hook

### Character Movement
- Belief challenged
- Choice forced
- Cost paid

### Canon Checks
- Resonance rules respected
- Artifact laws followed
- Ring logic intact

### Animation Hooks
- Visual anchor
- Camera idea
- Sound / atmosphere

---

## Prose Rules

- Full chapter prose is **never stored in Trello**
- Trello may contain:
  - Beat summaries
  - Notes
  - Constraints
- Prose lives in `/story/`

---

## Assistant Execution Rules

When working with the assistant:

- Assistant uses Trello card data as constraints
- Assistant does NOT invent canon
- Assistant flags conflicts before writing
- Assistant writes prose ONLY when chapter is in:
  **Writing This Week**

---

## Governing Principle

**Trello controls intent.  
Markdown controls truth.  
Prose serves the story.**
