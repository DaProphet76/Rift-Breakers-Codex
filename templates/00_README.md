# Templates

These templates are designed to keep every entry in the Codex consistent, searchable, and GitHub-wiki friendly.

## How to use
1. Copy the relevant template file into the correct folder (e.g., `world_bible/realms/`).
2. Rename the file using a stable slug, e.g. `spiritual_realm.md` or `artifact_ephod_first_keeper.md`.
3. Fill in the YAML front matter at the top.
4. Keep **Summary** short and factual; keep **Canon Notes** explicit.

## Required conventions
- Every `.md` file must begin with YAML front matter.
- Use `status: canon` only when the entry is stable and agreed.
- Prefer internal links by path/slug in `related_entries`.

## Template list
- `01_base_frontmatter.md` (useful as a starting point)
- Content-type templates: realm, tenet, artifact, character, event, location, faction, creature, systems/anomalies, timeline, scenes
