# Chapter 1 — Ignorance

The copper wash of evening filtered through the narrow window slit, tinting the walls of Asher Renn’s dwelling in dull industrial light.

He lay on his back, boots still on, staring at the ceiling.

The metal panels above him were patched in uneven seams of sealant the color of old rust. A hairline fracture near the ventilation duct clicked softly as the building adjusted pressure for the evening cycle.

The outer ring was rotating again.

Some were returning from shifts. Some were reporting for them. The machinery of New Babylonia never stopped; it only reassigned exhaustion.

Asher pushed himself upright slowly. The ache settled into him in layers—shoulders first, then lower spine, then the steady burn along his forearms from hours of lifting under fluorescent glare. The night shift had ended at dawn. He had stumbled home with the rest of the labor column and slept through the day without dreaming.

The device on the crate beside his cot blinked with a patient blue notification.

Transfer Complete.

He already knew the number.

He checked it anyway.

The amount sat there—precise, sterile, final.

Enough for rent allocation.
Enough for ration blocks.
Enough to remain compliant.

Not enough to replace the thinning soles of his boots.
Not enough to repair the micro-fracture in his left glove.
Not enough to absorb surprise.

There was always a surprise.

He exhaled once through his nose and locked the screen.

The city’s relay speakers crackled faintly outside.

“Evening cycle engaged. Citizens are reminded that service sustains prosperity.”

Prosperity.

He pulled off his boots and set them carefully beside the cot. The stitching along the heel had begun to split. He pressed it flat with his thumb as if that might delay reality.

After splashing water across his face, he shrugged into his jacket—the dark fabric marked with his registered tier insignia, stitched small but visible. Not the lowest caste.

Close enough that the difference rarely mattered.

He hesitated at the door.

Then he stepped into the corridor.

The outer walkway beyond the stairwell breathed recycled air and machine heat. Light strips hummed overhead, flickering slightly where maintenance had been deferred too long. Residents moved in quiet procession—some returning hollow-eyed, others heading toward assembly floors and processing plants.

Asher descended to the street level and merged with the evening current.

Vendors were unfolding metal tables along the wall seams. Portable heaters clicked to life. Steam rose from vats of nutrient broth thick enough to count as comfort.

“Walking like an old man already.”

The voice came from his right.

Mara stood beside her usual crate, shawl wrapped tight around narrow shoulders, silver hair braided close to her scalp. She sold ration tins and rumors in equal measure.

“I’m not that old,” Asher replied.

“You’re limping.”

“I’m walking.”

She leaned closer, lowering her voice while keeping her smile for passing customers.

“They doubled the quotas again in Manufacturing,” she said. “Heard it from a loader who drinks too much and thinks I don’t listen.”

“They’ll rotate him out,” Asher said.

“They will,” she agreed cheerfully. “Somewhere instructional.”

A patrol drone slid overhead along the rail line with a soft mechanical hum. Mara’s eyes tracked it without moving her head.

“You hear about the sweep?” she asked.

“No.”

“Three blocks east. Random compliance scans. Took two men and a woman. No noise. No announcement.”

Asher’s jaw tightened slightly.

“Compliance for what?” he asked.

Mara’s smile thinned.

“Does it matter?”

She pressed a small ration tin into his hand.

“Discount,” she said. “You look thinner.”

“I’m not.”

“You are.”

Her gaze flicked past him toward the main transit artery.

“You keep your head down tonight,” she murmured. “The city’s nervous.”

“I always keep my head down.”

“That’s what worries me.”

He slipped the tin into his pocket.

“Try not to outlive us all,” she called lightly as he stepped back into the flow.

“I’ll do my worst,” he replied.

The transit corridor opened ahead—wide, reinforced, lined with illuminated panels.

Recruitment posters covered the walls in repeating intervals.

Crisp uniforms.
Polished armor.
Clean lines.
Smiling faces looking toward a horizon the outer ring never saw.

SERVE THE CORE.
EARN ASCENSION.
STABILITY THROUGH STRENGTH.

The figures depicted were flawless. Unscarred. Upright.

Asher slowed.

One poster showed a young man no older than he was, standing beside a military transport vehicle beneath pristine white spires. The caption beneath read:

YOUR LOYALTY BUILDS TOMORROW.

He studied the man’s boots.

They were new.

No split stitching. No patched soles.

He moved on.

The corridor narrowed toward the first checkpoint gate. Metal barriers funneled pedestrian traffic into organized lanes. Scan arrays pulsed faint blue at measured intervals.

Even off-shift, movement between districts required clearance.

Asher joined the line.

Ahead of him, the gates hummed.
