## FOLDER PURPOSE & RULES

### world_bible — CANON (ABSOLUTE TRUTH)

Purpose:  
Holds immutable, omniscient rules of the universe.

Rules:
- No character POV
- No narrative prose
- Never unreliable
- Never contradicted by story content

If something occurs in the story, it must be explainable here.

---

### story — NARRATIVE (UNRELIABLE BY DESIGN)

Purpose:  
All fictional writing lives here.

Rules:
- POV-bound
- Characters do not know canon
- Science and history may be wrong
- Truth is revealed gradually

No canon rules are introduced here—only experienced.

---

### characters — DOSSIERS (OUT-OF-STORY FACTS)

Purpose:  
Structured character reference for the author.

Rules:
- No prose
- No POV
- Never quoted verbatim in story

---

### notes — NON-CANON / SCRATCH

Purpose:  
Idea storage, discarded concepts, experiments.

Rules:
- Not canon
- May contradict anything
- Safe to rewrite or delete

---

## CANON AUTHORITY ORDER (HIGHEST → LOWEST)

1. world_bible  
2. characters  
3. story  
4. notes  

Lower layers may never override higher layers.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Mystery is created by hiding truth from characters,  
not by hiding structure from the author.
