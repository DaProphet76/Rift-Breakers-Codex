# Chapter 01  
Walls remember.  
The outer ring wakes.

Morning came late to the outer districts.

Not because the sun delayed—only because the light had farther to travel, slipping past towers and shield-plates, losing strength as it went. By the time it reached the streets at the edge of the city, it was thin and colorless, more suggestion than warmth.

The boy woke to sirens.

They were not the kind that signaled attack. Those were sharper, urgent, meant to drive people indoors. These were slower, rhythmic—work-call tones that rolled across the outer ring like a tired breath, reminding everyone that the day had begun whether they were ready for it or not.

He lay still for a moment, listening.

Metal creaked somewhere above. A neighbor coughed through the wall—deep, wet, familiar. Far off, something boomed as a gate shifted position along the inner barricade. The sound traveled outward, losing authority with every echo until it reached this place as a dull thud, like a distant door being closed on someone else’s life.

He sat up.

The room was small. Everything was small out here. Low ceiling. Narrow cot. A single slit-window reinforced with wire and etched glass that dulled the view beyond it into a blur of gray shapes. The walls bore old cracks that had been sealed and resealed so many times they looked like scars layered atop scars.

He pulled on his boots and stood.

Outside, the street was already moving. People flowed past one another without greeting, heads down, shoulders tight. Couriers in patched jackets ran messages toward the inner ring. Vendors shouted half-hearted offers that no one answered. Overhead, the shield lattice hummed faintly—a sound everyone noticed only when it stopped.

Posters clung to the wall across the street.

Fresh ones had been layered over older notices, their edges curling in the morning chill. Faces stared out in stylized colors: young men and women caught mid-motion, hands raised, eyes bright with promise. Below each face, a crest. Below each crest, a sponsor mark.

**AWAKENED INSTITUTE — SECOND RING**  
*Applications Open*

He looked away.

Everyone knew someone who had applied. Everyone knew someone who hadn’t come back.

A pair of city enforcers passed at the end of the street, armor clean, movements precise. Their insignia marked them as inner-ring assigned—House Aurel by the cut of the sigil alone. They did not look toward the buildings. They never did. Their presence was a reminder, not a service.

“Did you hear?”

The voice came from his left. Old Mara, leaning in her doorway, shawl wrapped tight. She had lived in this building longer than anyone remembered, which meant she had survived things most people only whispered about.

“Another rift last night,” she said without waiting for a reply. “Far east. Fourth ring. Took a whole block.”

He nodded. That was the proper response. Shock was for people who could afford it.

“They say an Awakened closed it,” she added, eyes sharp now. “One of the new ones. Sponsored.”

“Good,” he said.

She snorted softly. “Good for who?”

The sirens changed tone—shift-call now. The day pushed forward.

He joined the flow toward the work corridors, boots striking worn stone. As he walked, he felt it again—that faint pressure behind his eyes. Not pain. Not quite. A hum, barely there, like standing too close to something powerful and pretending not to notice.

He clenched his jaw and kept moving.

Somewhere in the city, far closer to the center than this place would ever be, banners were being raised. Contracts signed. Training halls opened their doors.

Heroes were being made.

And out here, in the outer ring, the walls remembered everything they were built to keep out.

The boy did not know why the hum followed him.

Only that it had begun three nights ago.

And that it had not stopped.
