# Chapter 1 — Ignorance

The copper-tinged glow of the evening cycle crept through the narrow window slit and stretched thinly across the walls of Asher Renn’s dwelling, laying a pale ribbon over patched metal and tired seams. The building ticked and sighed around him—pressure valves shifting, a fan somewhere above coughing like an old man clearing his throat.

Asher lay still for a moment, letting the city finish deciding what day it was.

He had come home in the morning with his shoulders full of factory ache, shut the door against the corridor noise, and dropped into sleep without ceremony. Now evening had him by the collar again.

He pushed himself upright with a faint wince. The stiffness across his shoulders was not dramatic, but it was loyal. It had followed him home.

On the crate beside the cot sat the small pay device—scuffed plastic, one corner sealed with aging tape. Asher reached for it and thumbed the side.

The screen blinked to life.

**TRANSFER COMPLETE.**

He had checked it once before sleep claimed him. He checked it again now, as though repetition might shame the number into improving.

It did not.

The amount glowed back with calm indifference.

Enough for rent allocation.  
Enough for ration blocks.  
Enough to remain compliant.

Not enough for boots.  
Not enough for repairs.  
Not enough for misfortune.

A faint, humorless smile touched his mouth.

“Prosperity,” he muttered.

As if summoned, the relay speakers outside crackled. A woman’s carefully measured voice drifted through the thin walls.

“Evening cycle engaged. Citizens are reminded: faithful service sustains prosperity.”

Asher lifted his brows slightly.

“Of course it does.”

He rose, crossed the narrow room in three strides, and splashed cool water across his face. The drain gurgled resentfully. In the reflective panel above it, his features stared back—lean, sharp-jawed, close-cropped curls casting faint shadows across his brow. His eyes were alert despite the fatigue, studying even himself as though evaluating a piece of machinery.

“You’re still here,” he told the reflection quietly.

It offered no commentary.

He shrugged into his hoodie, then his battered jacket, smoothing the worn fabric down his arms. The backpack came next—scuffed, balanced, straps adjusted with practiced care. A careless bag invited hands. A settled one discouraged them.

He folded the device away, pressed his palm to the door panel, and stepped into the corridor.

---

Recycled air and machine heat greeted him. Light strips hummed overhead, flickering where maintenance had been postponed too long. Residents flowed along the walkway in steady currents—some returning from labor, others rising reluctantly into their shifts.

New Babylonia did not rest. It redistributed fatigue.

Asher descended the stairwell and stepped into the open artery of the outer ring. Evening commerce unfolded with stubborn determination. Portable heaters clicked alive. Vendors unfolded narrow tables from wall seams. Steam rose from vats of nutrient broth carrying a scent that tried valiantly to disguise its origin.

“Look at you,” came a voice from his right, brisk and amused. “Walking like a man twice your age.”

Asher did not turn immediately. “Evening, Mara.”

Old Mara stood beside her crate as always, shawl wrapped tight about narrow shoulders, silver hair braided close to her scalp. Her stall displayed ration tins, but her eyes traded in sharper currency.

“I lifted crates,” Asher replied.

“Crates don’t limp afterward.”

“I’m not limping.”

“You are.”

A patrol drone glided along the elevated rail overhead. Mara’s gaze tracked it briefly.

“They’re scanning harder,” she said conversationally. “Quiet about it, too. No shouting. Just subtraction.”

Asher’s jaw tightened. “You heard something.”

“I hear plenty.” She leaned closer. “Compliance sweep three blocks east. Took two men and a woman. Quietly. Like borrowed tools.”

“For what?”

Mara’s brows rose. “You think they explain themselves?”

She pressed a ration tin into his hand.

“Mara—”

“Discount. You’re thinner.”

“I’m not.”

“You are.”

He slipped the tin into his pocket.

“Keep your head down tonight,” she added, glancing toward the transit corridor. “The city’s listening harder than usual.”

“I always keep my head down.”

“That,” Mara replied dryly, “is what worries me.”

Asher stepped back into the pedestrian current.

“Try not to outlive us all,” she called.

“I make no promises.”

Her laughter followed him until the corridor swallowed it.

---

The transit corridor widened ahead, steel ribs arching overhead like the skeleton of some enormous mechanical beast. Recruitment posters lined the walls in illuminated sequence—fresh, crisp, too clean for the outer ring.

Crisp uniforms.  
Polished armor.  
Clean boots.

**SERVE THE CORE.**  
**EARN ASCENSION.**  
**STABILITY THROUGH STRENGTH.**

Asher slowed.

One poster showed a young recruit beside a transport vehicle, chin lifted toward a distant skyline that bore no resemblance to this district.

His gaze dropped to the boots.

No cracks. No split stitching.

The built-in lighting caught Asher’s cheek and eye, momentarily dressing him in borrowed brightness.

“Careful,” came a voice just behind his left shoulder. “If you stare any harder, they’ll recruit your thoughts.”

Asher turned.

Kade stood half a step back, already masked, hood casting deliberate shadow. His eyes were sharp, faint amusement hidden within them.

“You’ve been practicing,” Asher said.

“Staying alive,” Kade replied. “It’s a skill.”

Asher nodded toward the poster. “I was looking at the boots.”

“That’s the gateway,” Kade said. “Boots today, oath tomorrow.”

Workers shuffled past. Kade lowered his voice slightly.

“You heading through Checkpoint Nine?”

“I need to cross.”

“Don’t look nervous.”

“I don’t.”

“You look offended,” Kade corrected mildly. “Like the city insulted your fairness.”

“And you look like you’ve already judged it guilty.”

“Saves time.”

They walked.

---

Metal barriers formed orderly lanes. Scan arrays pulsed faint blue. Even off-shift, movement required clearance.

Asher joined the line.

Two places ahead, a young man kept rubbing his palms against his trousers.

He stepped forward.

The scanner chimed once.

Paused.

Red.

“Citizen. Step aside.”

“There’s a mistake,” the young man said, voice cracking. “I’m registered—”

“Step aside.”

Two officers guided him away—not violently, not loudly. Efficient.

“I didn’t do anything,” he insisted, voice thinning. “Please—”

“Compliance review.”

He disappeared around the barrier corner.

The line exhaled carefully.

The scanner resumed its blue pulse.

Asher stepped forward when called.

He placed his palm against the reader.

Cold metal. A heartbeat of evaluation.

Green.

“Proceed.”

He did not hurry. He did not look back.

On the far side, the light shifted warmer and dirtier.

Kade waited.

“See?” Kade said softly. “No reason required.”

Asher adjusted his backpack strap. “He thought they’d need one.”

“That’s the mistake.”

Kade tilted his head toward a dim side passage.

“I’ve got salvage,” he said lightly. “Real salvage. Enough to make that transfer number less insulting.”

“Where?”

“Past the bright lanes.”

Asher understood.

“That’s gang territory.”

“It is.”

“I’ve scavenged before,” Asher said. “But not there.”

Kade met his gaze. “First time for everything.”

Behind them, the checkpoint chimed steadily.

Asher looked once toward the regulated flow, then toward the shadowed passage.

“When?” he asked.

“Tonight.”

A breath passed between them.

“All right,” Asher said.

Kade turned without hesitation.

Asher followed him into the dimmer lanes.
