# Chapter 00 — The Lore We Were Raised On

## Purpose
Establish the realm’s taught history and present social order through a young male narrator from the outer (ghetto) districts.
This is a voiceover monologue: learned lore, not firsthand witness.

- **POV character:** Unnamed young male (outer district)
- **POV limitations:** Does not know the true metaphysics behind the Sundering or the realms; recites public doctrine.

## Setting
- **Location:** Outer district (ghetto ring), unspecified city
- **Time:** Present era, after the Resonance
- **Atmosphere:** Bitter, mythic, controlled anger under restraint

## Scene Beats
1. Establish the Sundering Fall as taught history; introduce the Scar as the enduring wound.
2. Introduce the Eight Great Families doctrine: seven to rule, one to serve (twelve branches).
3. Transition into the Rift Age and the creation of district rings (center safe, outer exposed).
4. Introduce the Dig and the Resonance; explain the Echo and the awakening of abilities.
5. Close on the narrator’s identity and position: born after the Resonance, raised in the outer ring—this is where the story begins.

## Voiceover (Draft)
*Young male voice. Calm. Reflective. Not heroic.*

They tell us the world ended once.

Not all at once.
But in fire and stone, when the sky fell and left a wound so deep the land never healed.

There is still a place where nothing grows.
A vast scar in the realm where storms bend away and life forgets how to return.

That was the Sundering Fall.

They say the survivors rebuilt.
That eight great families rose from the ruin and carried the world forward.

Seven to rule.
One to serve.

They taught us this was order.

After the wars came the rifts.
Cracks in the world that bled monsters into our streets.

So we retreated inward.
District by district. Ring by ring.

The inner cities grew bright and guarded.
The outer rings learned to listen for screams and measure nights by survival.

Then came the dig.

When they unearthed the artifact, the world shuddered—
and the Resonance rolled outward like a memory remembered by the blood.

An Echo settled into us.

Some awakened.
Not kings. Not lords.
People from streets like mine.

Demons learned they could die.

They call those people heroes now.
Train them. Brand them.

I was born after the Resonance.
In the outer districts.
Where history teaches obedience—and hope learns to hide.

This is the world as we were taught it.

And this…

is where the story begins.

## Conflict
- **External:** The world itself (rifts, demons, unequal protection)
- **Internal:** The narrator’s restrained rage at inherited injustice

## Reveal / Information Drop
- The Scar exists and is avoided.
- Society is organized by Eight Great Families doctrine.
- District rings stratify safety and human worth.
- The Resonance created an Echo that awakened abilities.

## Outcome
The reader is oriented: history, threat, class structure, and the catalyst for heroism.
