They moved together cautiously, neither fully yielding the lead.

Sera swept the chamber first, weapon tracking angles Asher wouldn’t have noticed—blind corners, collapsed alcoves, the way sound carried strangely along the curved walls. Asher stayed close without crowding her, eyes drawn instead to the room itself.

“This wasn’t a station,” he said quietly.

“No,” Sera agreed. “Stations funnel people. This…” She gestured with her chin. “This coordinated them.”

They passed through a narrow access into a secondary chamber half-sealed by fallen plating. Inside, the air felt different—still cold, but less oppressive, like the weight had thinned. The walls here were lined with panels, many shattered, others miraculously intact.

Maps.

Not the ring schematics everyone knew. These were older—etched overlays showing the city before consolidation. Streets without walls. Transit lines that cut straight through what were now sealed districts. Handwritten annotations layered over the projections, some faded, some etched deep enough to scar the surface.

Asher stopped short.

“I’ve never seen these,” he said.

“No one has,” Sera replied. “They erased most of it after the retreats.”

He stepped closer, fingers hovering just short of the surface. “It wasn’t meant to be permanent, was it?”

Sera didn’t answer right away. “Most things aren’t,” she said finally. “Power just likes to pretend otherwise.”

Beyond the maps, a recessed chamber sat half-hidden behind a warped bulkhead. Its door was old-world—thick, circular, sealed with mechanical locks instead of lattice controls. Frost rimed the edges, but the metal itself was too cold, unnaturally so.

Asher felt it before he touched it.

A pull. Subtle. Like static under the skin.

Sera noticed him slow. “Don’t.”

“I won’t,” he said. “I just—”

The lock disengaged with a soft, reluctant click.

They both froze.

Nothing rushed them. No alarms sounded. The door hissed open just enough to reveal a narrow vault beyond.

Inside, a single pedestal stood intact.

Mounted to it was a device—arm-length, angular, unfinished. Plates overlapped without symmetry. Conduits ended abruptly, severed mid-design. Whatever power source it had once held was missing.

But the cold remained.

Asher swallowed. “This is salvage.”

Sera studied it, instincts at war with exhaustion. “This is trouble.”

“Those aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said, then winced at his own breath hitching.

He reached out carefully, lifting the device free. The cold bit instantly—not burning, not numbing, just present. Heavy. Dormant.

No activation. No response.

“Dead,” he murmured. “Or sleeping.”

Sera watched him for a long second. Then she nodded once. “Pocket it. We don’t leave things like this behind.”

He slid it beneath his jacket, against his ribs.

They didn’t stay.

The way back blurred—junctions passed, lights flickering weaker than before. Asher’s steps slowed, pain catching up now that adrenaline had nowhere left to go. His vision swam.

“You’re hurt,” Sera said, not turning.

“I’ve been worse,” he lied.

He made it three more steps before his knees buckled.

Sera caught him before he hit the floor, surprising both of them with the speed of it. She lowered him against the wall, movements brisk but careful.

“Sit,” she ordered.

Asher laughed weakly. “You outrank me, don’t you?”

“Barely,” she said. “And only today.”

She checked his ribs, her touch firm, professional. “You don’t die well,” she added.

“Working on it.”

For a moment, neither spoke. Just two people catching breath in a city that refused to give any.

“You didn’t run,” Asher said finally. “Back there.”

Sera’s jaw tightened. “I did.”

“Not far enough to matter.”

She looked at him then—not assessing, not commanding. Just seeing.

“You shouldn’t have been there,” she said.

“Neither should you.”

A beat.

Then, quieter: “That thing earlier,” he said. “Whatever it was… it noticed you.”

“Yes,” she said.

“And it stopped.”

She didn’t answer.

Footsteps echoed somewhere distant.

Sera stood, offering him an arm. After a second, Asher took it.

“Let’s move,” she said. “We’re running out of borrowed time.”
