## Chapter 03 — Batch 01

### Spit out
The corridor did not end.

It *released* them.

One moment they were moving through warped metal and heat that didn’t belong, the next they were spilling through a torn maintenance hatch into open air that tasted like rust, old rain, and ash.

Asher hit the ground on one knee. His palm stung where it had pressed the warm wall. The pressure behind his eyes had dulled, but it hadn’t gone away. It sat there like a thumbprint.

Kade stumbled out after him and immediately looked back into the hatch, as if expecting the corridor to follow. “That’s not the same line,” he said.

Rennick emerged last, slower than the others, and stared up at the ceiling as if measuring distance by instinct. “No,” he agreed. “We didn’t come out where we went in.”

They were in the outer ring—*but not the outer ring Asher knew.*

This section had once been built for people who expected to live longer than a season. A wide service boulevard ran between collapsed facades. Dead sponsor screens leaned at angles, their glass spiderwebbed and clouded. Above, the skeleton of a skywalk bridged two buildings that had partially fallen into each other like exhausted fighters.

Asher’s gaze snagged on a sign half-buried by debris.

BABYLONIA TRANSIT AUTHORITY  
DOCK ACCESS — AUTHORIZED CREW ONLY

Kade saw it too. His jaw tightened. “We’re far west.”

Rennick crouched and brushed dust off a metal plate bolted to the ground. The serial stamp was still legible. “Old grid,” he muttered. “Pre-collapse service run.”

Asher swallowed. “So… we’re outside the normal scav lanes.”

Kade’s laugh was quiet and humorless. “Yeah. Which means the gangs won’t be the only ones who care.”

### Two paths
They moved off the boulevard and into the shadow of an overhang where the wind didn’t carry as far. Kade glanced toward the horizon—toward the faint glow that marked where rings still functioned.

“We need back into Ring 3,” he said, voice low. “Not Ring 4. Not the outer lane. Ring 3.”

Asher nodded. He understood what Ring 3 meant: tighter gates, more cameras, more patrols, but also *people.* Movement. The chance to disappear into routine again.

Kade pointed left with two fingers. “That way is the docks.”

Asher followed the gesture and saw it: distant floodlight towers, a line of container stacks like dark teeth, and beyond them the rigid outline of temporary barracks.

“A military encampment,” Asher said.

“By the transport docks,” Kade confirmed. “If they spot us, they’ll detain first and decide later.”

Rennick didn’t look pleased, but he looked *certain.* “They won’t ask questions that let you go home.”

Kade pointed the opposite direction. “Or we take the service ports.”

Asher’s eyes tracked right: broken intake tunnels, half-collapsed utility arches, and a chain of old access hatches set into the ground like scars.

Kade’s mouth twisted. “It loops wide, but it gets us to a side entrance back into Ring 3.”

“And passes through gang territory,” Rennick added.

Kade’s eyes flicked to him. “Everything passes through gang territory if you walk long enough.”

Asher stared at both routes and felt his stomach tighten. Military meant uniforms, scanners, lists. Gangs meant blades, territory, and the kind of violence that didn’t pretend to be procedure.

He thought of the boundary behind them—how the rival gang had stopped short, unwilling to cross. He thought of what Rennick had said in the corridor: *It notices some people faster.*

And he thought of the way the place had pressed on him—like a lock trying a key.

“What’s closer?” Asher asked.

Kade didn’t hesitate. “Docks.”

“And what’s safer?” Asher asked.

Rennick answered that one. “Neither.”

Silence held for a beat. Not comfortable. Not dramatic. Just three people trying to choose a kind of danger they could survive.

Kade rubbed his thumb along the inside of his sleeve, a nervous motion he tried to hide. “If we go docks, we might not come back out.”

Asher heard the truth under it: *Not together. Not the same. Maybe not alive.*

Rennick looked toward the service ports. “Then we go wide.”

Kade exhaled once, sharp. “Fine. Wide.”

Asher nodded, because his throat didn’t want to cooperate. “Wide.”

They started walking.

### Ghosts of the outer ring
The service ports weren’t visible from the street until you were almost on top of them.

That was how the city built them—hidden, protected, meant for workers and maintenance crews, not citizens.

The tunnels were broad enough for cargo carts, the walls reinforced with ribbed plating that had been painted white once, long ago.

Now everything was stained. Smoke. Water. Time.

Asher stepped around a pile of collapsed paneling and froze.

A child’s shoe lay on top—small, cracked, the sole split. Next to it was a plastic charm shaped like a bird, its cheap paint worn almost clean.

He stared too long.

Kade noticed and didn’t mock him for it. He just said, “People lived out here.”

Asher’s voice came out rough. “Why leave the shoe?”

Rennick’s answer was quiet. “Because leaving fast means you don’t stop to collect what proves you existed.”

They passed a doorway blown inward. Inside was a room that had once been someone’s home—an old cot frame, a table welded from scrap, a strip of faded fabric still hung like a curtain. On the wall, someone had mounted a dead holo-frame. The screen was shattered, but the corner still held a printed photo behind it, protected by chance.

A family. Four faces. Smiling like they believed the future would stay stable.

Asher felt something twist in his chest. He didn’t know them. He’d never meet them. But the evidence of them made the outer ring feel less like a “zone” and more like a wound.

Kade walked a little faster after that.

As if speed could keep him from thinking.

Rennick slowed at a junction where the floor dipped. He lifted a broken piece of equipment from a pile of debris and turned it in his hands.

It was a drone chassis—maintenance-class, not combat. The casing was split, not by impact but by *heat.* The edges looked softened, pulled, and hardened again.

Asher’s eyes narrowed. The memory of warm metal surged—his palm on the corridor wall, the unnatural heat from below.

Rennick met his gaze. “Same kind of damage,” he said.

Kade’s voice sharpened. “Don’t start.”

Rennick didn’t flinch. “You want the truth or comfort?”

Kade didn’t answer.

Asher tried to speak anyway. “So the city didn’t abandon the outer ring because of gangs.”

Kade glanced at him, expression tight. “Gangs don’t melt metal.”

They kept moving.

Asher’s head pulsed once—hard enough to make him stumble. He caught himself on a railing and felt a faint vibration through the metal.

Not mechanical.

Not wind.

Something like resonance—like the world was a wire that had been plucked and was still humming.

Rennick saw the stumble. “You all right?”

Asher forced his hand off the railing. “Yeah. Just—” He stopped, searching for words that wouldn’t make him sound crazy. “This place feels… awake.”

Kade shot him a look. “Don’t.”

But Asher heard the fear beneath Kade’s refusal. Kade had already seen too much today. He didn’t have room for *more.*

They reached an access span where the service ports widened into a shallow basin—an old loading depression that fed into multiple hatches.

And there, half-buried in dust, was something that still had power.

A small beacon post. Military-grade. The casing was scratched and old, but a single indicator light blinked slow and patient, like a heartbeat that had never stopped.

Kade swore under his breath. “That shouldn’t be live.”

Rennick stepped in front of it, protective without thinking. “Don’t touch it.”

Asher didn’t intend to.

But the pressure behind his eyes sharpened, and for a fraction of a second he saw the beacon differently—lines and seams outlined in faint, impossible geometry, like the corridor had shown him.

The beacon’s light shifted.

Once.

Twice.

Then it blinked faster.

Kade went still. “Tell me that’s not a ping.”

Rennick’s jaw clenched. “It’s a ping.”

Asher’s mouth went dry. “To who?”

Rennick looked toward the distant floodlights of the docks, then toward the darker lanes where gang territory would begin again.

“To anyone,” he said. “Military. Gangs. Something else.”

Kade’s eyes cut to Asher. Not accusing. Not yet.

But measuring.

“We move,” Rennick said, the same word he’d used in the corridor. Like it was the only prayer he trusted.

They left the beacon blinking behind them and walked faster into the service ports, knowing—now—that whichever danger they’d chosen, it had already started choosing them back.

### Route Lock — Docks Way
They didn’t stop running until the service corridor widened and the air stopped tasting like that beacon’s warning.

Only then did Kade raise a fist.

Freeze.

They pressed into a recess where the wall had buckled inward, a pocket of shadow behind an old utility cabinet. Kade listened with his whole body—head angled, shoulders still, breath shallow.

Rennick crouched and kept his injured side guarded, eyes scanning the dark like he expected it to move.

Asher tried to slow his breathing. The pressure behind his eyes pulsed once, then eased. He hated that it *came and went* like it belonged to something else.

Kade spoke without looking at them. “Change of route.”

Rennick’s brow tightened. “You said we were going wide.”

“We were,” Kade said. “Until that beacon started calling the world.”

Asher glanced back the way they’d come. Nothing moved. Nothing followed. But the feeling of being *seen* stayed.

Kade kept his voice low. “We take the dock route now. Underground.”

Rennick shook his head once. “That puts us near the encampment.”

“It puts us near the gates,” Kade corrected. “Near infrastructure that still connects to Ring 3.”

“And near soldiers who shoot first,” Rennick said.

Kade finally looked at him. “And near places gangs don’t control. You want to go back through turf after we lit up a ping? No.”

Rennick didn’t answer. His silence was agreement wearing a mask.

Asher cleared his throat. “What exactly is ‘underground’?”

Kade looked past him, down the corridor where the ceiling seams changed—older construction, heavier ribs, thicker conduits. “Old transit tunnels. Service arteries. Maintenance lines that got sealed when the outer ring got cut loose.”

Asher frowned. “Sealed means closed.”

Kade’s mouth tightened. “Sealed means *someone wanted it closed*. Doesn’t mean it can’t be opened.”

Rennick leaned closer, voice lower. “Those lines are deeper. Less scavenged. Less mapped.”

Asher understood what he wasn’t saying: less *help*.

Kade shifted his weight and pulled a small, battered tag from inside his jacket—an old route marker, metal, stamped with a faded code. He held it up just long enough for them to see the worn engraving.

“Got this off a dock runner two winters back,” Kade said. “He said it was how crews moved supplies when the surface lanes got hot.”

Rennick stared at it. “You kept it.”

Kade didn’t blink. “I keep what keeps me alive.”

The tunnel ahead sloped downward, swallowing light in slow degrees. The further it fell, the more the air changed—colder, wetter, metallic in a way that reminded Asher of machine rooms and closed doors.

They moved again, single file.

As they descended, the walls shifted from scavenged concrete to old plated sections stamped with municipal codes. Some markings were still legible beneath rust:

**BTA ACCESS — AUTHORIZED CREW**
**MAINT ARTERY — DO NOT BLOCK**
**EMERGENCY SEAL POINT**

Rennick ran his fingers over one of the warnings, then pulled his hand back as if the metal had teeth. “This is pre-abandonment.”

Asher’s eyes stayed on the seal-point text. “So they didn’t just stop maintaining the outer ring.”

Kade glanced at him. “They *cut it off.*”

They reached a pressure door that had once been automatic. Its track was warped. Its control panel was dead. A strip of red paint across the seam read:

**SEALED BY ORDER**

No gang tag layered over it. No scav marks. No forced entry.

Just an official line across a door no one had wanted to argue with.

Kade set his shoulder against the seam and tested it—once, twice—then stepped back and pulled his pry bar free.

Rennick’s voice sharpened. “If we open that, we leave evidence.”

Kade wedged the bar into the seam anyway. “If we don’t open it, we don’t get home.”

Asher watched the door like it was watching him back.

Somewhere deep beyond it, a faint vibration traveled through the floor—subtle, irregular, like a distant engine trying to remember how to turn.

Kade leaned his weight into the bar.

Metal groaned.

The seal cracked.

A breath of colder air spilled out from the dark on the other side, carrying the smell of old coolant and something else—something dry and ancient, like dust that had been trapped for years.

Kade held the opening and looked at them. “Once we’re in, we don’t make noise. We don’t stop. And we don’t touch anything we don’t have to.”

Rennick nodded, jaw tight.

Asher swallowed and stepped forward.

They slipped into the deeper arteries of the Outer Ring—into tunnels built for a living city—and the door eased shut behind them with a slow, deliberate scrape.

Not a slam.

A closing.

Like the outer ring itself didn’t want them to leave.
