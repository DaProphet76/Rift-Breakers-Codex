# Chapter 1 — Morning Comes Late

Evening came like a careful hand.

Not with a blaze of honest sunset—those belonged to places nearer the city’s heart—but with a slow loosening of gray above the outer ring. The shield-lattice overhead bruised faintly purple where the day thinned against it, and the street lamps flickered awake one by one, as if reluctant to be noticed.

Asher woke with his cheek stuck to his sleeve.

For a moment he did not move. The cot’s thin mattress pressed its wire ribs into his shoulder. Pipes groaned somewhere inside the walls. The building shifted its weight like an old animal settling deeper into its bones.

Night shift.

He rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling. The air smelled faintly of copper and dust. Conduit work clung to him—metal filings beneath the nails, that dull ache in the forearms that came from holding tools too long without complaint.

On the crate beside his cot lay his pay-chit.

He reached for it before he meant to.

The strip of synth-paper was clean and sharply stamped. The number printed across its face was equally clean.

He didn’t need to read it twice.

He did the math anyway.

Rent for Block Twelve: **112 credits**, due tomorrow before third bell.  
Rations for the week, even if stretched thin: **38 credits**.  
Building levy—“maintenance,” though nothing ever improved: **17 credits**.

His pay: **146**.

He exhaled slowly.

Even if he cut corners. Even if he skipped hot meals. Even if he stretched water into broth and broth into something that pretended to be stew—

It would not be enough.

Not for the next break. Not for the next surprise.

Something always failed.

He folded the pay-chit once, carefully, and slid it into his inner pocket. No need to look at it again. The number would not change.

He dressed without hurry. Worn brown jacket. Hooded layer beneath. Boots laced tight. Gloves tucked into belt. His pack waited by the door, straps repaired twice over, weight familiar against his shoulders.

He checked the latch when he left.

Not because he feared thieves.

Because unlocked doors invited questions.

The stairwell smelled of wax and old cooking oil.

On the second landing, a door creaked open before he reached it.

Old Mara stood framed in the dim hall light, shawl wrapped tight though the air was not cold. Her gray braid hung over one shoulder like a coiled rope.

“You’re late to the living,” she said dryly.

“I just got off a night shift, Mara,” Asher replied, keeping his voice even. “If I look half-dead, it’s because I feel it.”

“I know you worked.” Her eyes scanned him with clinical precision. “You smell like inner conduits and men who pretend exhaustion is a badge.”

He gave a tired huff that might’ve been a laugh on a better day. “Evening to you, too.”

Mara leaned forward slightly, lowering her voice though the corridor was empty.

“They’ve put up new papers.”

“As if they ever stop putting up papers,” Asher said, shifting his pack higher. “There’s always something pasted over something else.”

“These are brighter.” Her fingers tightened at her shawl’s edge. “Second Ring. Awakened Institute. Applications open.”

Asher’s expression stayed neutral by force. “They do not post those for people like us, and you know it.”

“People like us,” Mara echoed, as if she’d heard the phrase a thousand times and disliked it every time. “That place does not give. It takes.”

Asher took a careful step down. “People still go, though. Enough of them do that the rumors never die.”

“People vanish,” she corrected gently. “And the ones who return don’t return *here*. They don’t come back to these stairs like nothing happened.”

Silence stretched between them, thick with the things neither of them wanted to name.

“You be careful in the corridors tonight,” Mara added.

Asher paused. “You are not saying that for the pleasure of hearing yourself talk. What happened?”

“I heard the tone change earlier,” she said, voice thinning. “Not the screaming one. The quiet one.”

The quiet one.

Asher’s jaw tightened. “Then they’re running lists again.”

Mara studied him. “You’re walking tight,” she observed. “Is your pay lighter than you were promised?”

“It is exactly what they stamped on the chit,” Asher said, and his bitterness came out softer than he intended. “It just doesn’t cover what it used to.”

Mara nodded once, as if that confirmed something she’d already suspected. “The city squeezes hardest when it smiles.”

“I will keep my head down and get where I’m going,” Asher said. “That’s all anyone can do out here.”

Mara sniffed. “That’s what they count on.”

Her door shut with a decisive click.

The street outside Block Twelve moved with evening purpose.

Lantern light pooled on wet stone. Vendors called half-hearted offers into the air. The scent of hot oil drifted sharp and tempting. Above, the shield-lattice hummed—a low, constant vibration most only noticed when it shifted.

Asher joined the flow toward the transit corridor.

Inside, the city showed its bones: rusted beams, patched wiring, old numbering painted over too many times. And there, on the right-hand wall, the new posters gleamed too brightly for the place.

Four faces.

Young. Strong. Unlined by worry.

**AWAKENED INSTITUTE — SECOND RING**  
**APPLICATIONS OPEN**

A crest shimmered faintly beneath the lettering.

Asher slowed despite himself.

The painted eyes looked steady. Certain. As if they had never counted credits twice and still come up short.

A child reached toward one of the posters. His mother caught his wrist and lowered it quickly, whispering something sharp into his ear.

Asher forced his gaze away and kept moving.

---

Checkpoint Nine narrowed the corridor into single file.

Three inner-ring guards stood at ease. Clean armor. House sigils. Movements precise and unhurried.

“Palms out,” one said.

Asher stepped forward and raised his hands without argument.

The scanner swept his palms, his wrists, his throat. A low hum vibrated through the air.

**Green.**

He let out the breath he’d been holding and moved aside.

Behind him, a broad-shouldered worker lifted trembling hands.

The scanner hummed.

Silence.

Then—

**Red.**

The sound cut clean.

The man’s breath hitched. “That’s wrong—my papers are clean. I’ve worked this corridor for eight years.”

A guard raised a gloved hand, gentle but absolute. “Sir. Don’t.”

Another guard took his elbow—not roughly. Just firmly.

“This way.”

“I haven’t done anything,” the man whispered, voice cracking despite his effort to keep it steady. “I don’t even know what you think you saw.”

No one looked at him.

That was how it worked.

He was led through a side gate.

The line resumed.

It always resumed.

Asher walked forward, pulse steady only by force. He did not look back.

---

The market spine widened beyond the checkpoint.

Lanterns glowed behind wire cages. Steam rose from cookpots. Buyers and sellers spoke in careful tones. The illusion of normal settled back into place like a curtain.

Someone fell into step beside him.

Asher did not startle. He simply let his hand hover nearer his pack strap.

“Keeps you honest, that red tone,” the newcomer murmured.

Kade.

Hood shadowing his face. Mask in place. Cloak edges ragged as torn banners. His eyes were sharp and assessing.

“You didn’t need eyes to know what happened back there,” Asher said quietly. “That sound turns everyone into stone.”

“I heard it,” Kade replied, gaze flicking toward the checkpoint. “It carries far.”

They walked together without declaring it.

Kade’s eyes slid over Asher’s jacket seams and the fatigue in his posture. “You’re not headed toward shift bell.”

“I finished my shift this morning,” Asher said, and his voice tightened with restrained irritation. “I slept all day, and I am not going back just to prove I’m obedient.”

Kade’s attention sharpened. “They paid you already.”

“They did,” Asher answered. “And it still doesn’t reach far enough.”

“How short are you?”

Asher kept his eyes forward. “Short enough that the numbers won’t stop talking to me.”

Kade’s mouth moved under the mask—almost a smile, but not kind. “I can quiet them.”

Asher halted near the edge of lantern light and turned just enough to see Kade properly. “If you’re offering a loan, I’m refusing it now, so we don’t waste time pretending.”

“I didn’t say loan.”

“That is not better,” Asher said flatly.

They stood as the market flowed around them—boots scuffing, carts rattling, murmurs rising and dying like sparks.

“There’s a run,” Kade said.

“As in scavenging,” Asher replied, careful. “Because I have done that before, and I know what that word usually means.”

“Not the sanctioned kind.”

Asher’s jaw tightened. He’d pulled copper from dead conduit walls, pried sealed panels loose, crawled under forgotten walkways with his knees soaked and his teeth chattering. He knew risk. He also knew *lines*.

“Where are you talking about?” he asked, every syllable measured.

“Past the third service gate,” Kade said quietly. “Into streets that don’t answer to guard sigils.”

Asher felt the chill of it settle in his ribs. “You mean gang-controlled territory.”

“You said it.”

“I don’t go there,” Asher said, and this time it came out firm, not clipped. “I’m not stupid, and I’m not brave for sport.”

“No,” Kade agreed. “You don’t.”

The certainty in Kade’s tone stung more than mockery would have.

“Then why bring it to me at all?” Asher demanded, voice low but edged. “If you already decided what kind of man I am, keep walking.”

Kade’s gaze held his, steady as a drawn blade. “Because you’re careful,” he said. “Because you don’t panic. Because you can take something apart without breaking it. And because you need credits badly enough that you’re trying not to admit it.”

Asher’s throat tightened, but he didn’t look away. “I need credits to pay my expenses,” he said, controlled and plain. “That does not mean I’m going to get myself killed for them.”

“There’s a meet tomorrow night,” Kade continued, ignoring the flare of pride like he’d expected it. “Old pump house. You won’t cross anything yet. You’ll see who’s going. You’ll hear the plan before you decide.”

Asher’s suspicion sharpened. “Who’s leading it?”

Kade paused—just long enough to matter.

“Rennick.”

The name landed heavy.

Asher didn’t like how quickly his mind supplied all the whisper-stories that came with it. He forced his voice steady. “Why would Rennick want *me* anywhere near his business?”

“Because he wants hands,” Kade said. “Bodies that can carry. People who can move quietly and keep their heads when something goes wrong.”

Asher looked back down the market spine—the lanterns, the tired faces, the careful quiet. Behind him, Checkpoint Nine waited for another red chime.

He thought of **112**.  
Of **38**.  
Of **17**.  
Of **146**.

Short is short.

He swallowed, then spoke with deliberate clarity. “Tell me the time again, and tell me exactly where to stand so I’m not wandering around looking guilty.”

Kade’s eyes narrowed, assessing the surrender he hadn’t earned—only cornered.

“Second bell after dusk,” Kade said. “Old pump house. Come alone. Keep your hood up. Don’t bring anything you can’t afford to lose.”

Asher held Kade’s gaze a moment longer, then nodded once, tight. “I will be there. And if this is a trap, I’ll know you set it.”

Kade drifted back into shadow, as if the darkness had been saving a place for him.

Asher remained in lantern light, the decision settling onto his shoulders like added weight.

He had rent due.

He had rations to buy.

He had a life that did not add up.

Tomorrow night, at the pump house—

He would go.
